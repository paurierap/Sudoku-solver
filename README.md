# Sudoku Generator and Solver

A C++ implementation of a Sudoku generator and solver. It generates valid Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty and solves them using either naive and heuristic-based backtracking.

## Features

- Lightweight `Sudoku` class stores values using `int` bitmaps for each row, column and sub-box. Bitwise operations on the trailing 9 bits determine the value of a cell.
- Sudoku boards can be generated with 4 different difficulties: `easy`, `medium`, `hard` and `expert`. These are generated by randomly filling a board, and removing cells according to a clue number that determines difficulty.
- Generated sudokus are valid and have a unique solution.
- Two algorithms are available for solving:
  - Naive backtracking: every empty cell is visited and all 9 digits are tested. 
  - Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic: the next cell is chosen according to the one with least valid candidates. Performance is around x10 compared to the previous.
- Performance measurement uses a lightweight `Timer` utility.
- Pretty-print puzzles to the terminal.

## Build Instructions

### Requirements
- C++17 or later
- CMake (optional, if you provide a CMakeLists.txt)
- A standard C++ compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC)

### Example (with g++)
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o sudoku
```

## Usage

### Random or chosen difficulty
```cpp
#include "Sudoku.hpp"

int main() {

    // An easy and a random sudoku:
    Sudoku sudoku_chosen("easy"), sudoku_random;
    std::cout << sudoku_chosen << sudoku_random;

    sudoku_chosen.solve("MRV");
    sudoku_random.solve("MRV");

    std::cout << sudoku_chosen << sudoku_random;
}
```

### From a given board

Here, 0's are treated as empty spaces. For example:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> board = {
    {5,3,0, 0,7,0, 0,0,0},
    {6,0,0, 1,9,5, 0,0,0},
    ...
}

Sudoku sudoku(board);
```

## Performance

Typical timings without compiler optimization:
- Puzzle generation is around 10 ms.
- Solving (depending on difficulty):
  - Naive backtracking is around 500-1000 µs.
  - MRV backtracking is around 30-100 µs.
